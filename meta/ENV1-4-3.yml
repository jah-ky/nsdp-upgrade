ComputationMethod: "\_* Maps will be designed and created using geographic information\
  \ system and remote sensing software (QGIS).\n* We use the land capability assessment\
  \ method to assess land suitability for existing and potential agricultural and\
  \ non-agricultural uses. The method identifies possible physical, chemical and degradation\
  \ constraints to land use on particular soils and landscapes. This information is\
  \ then used by planners, managers and advisers to improve sustainable development."
ComputationUnit: Land area sq.km
Concept: Land-use capability maps must not be confused with land-use maps. Capability
  maps shows the potential uses usually in relation to farming) whilst the land-use
  maps show the actual use for the land at the present time.
DataSource: ' department of lands, survey and registry.'
Definition: "Land-use capability maps are maps created to represent the potential\
  \ uses of a \u201Cunit\u201D of land. They are measured using various indicators,\
  \ although the most common are five physical factors (rock type, soil type, slope,\
  \ erosion degree and type and vegetation)."
