  The change in underlying inflation rate refers to the difference in the rate
  of inflation when certain volatile or temporary factors are excluded from the
  calculation. The purpose of analyzing underlying inflation is to get a clearer
  picture of the long-term trend in prices by removing the effects of short-term
  fluctuations that may not reflect the true underlying inflationary pressures
  in the economy.


  Underlying inflation is often calculated by excluding certain volatile
  components from the inflation index, such as food and energy prices, which can
  be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors like weather conditions,
  geopolitical events, or supply disruptions. By excluding these components,
  economists and policymakers aim to identify the core inflation rate, which
  provides a more stable measure of price changes.


  The change in underlying inflation rate, therefore, refers to the difference
  in the core inflation rate over a specific period. It could indicate whether
  inflationary pressures are increasing or decreasing when the effects of
  volatile factors are removed. This information is valuable for policymakers
  when formulating monetary policy and for businesses and consumers in their
  decision-making processes, as it provides insights into the broader trend of
  price changes in an economy.
Concept: >-
  The "change in underlying inflation rate" refers to the difference in the rate
  of inflation after removing volatile or temporary factors from the
  calculation. It helps identify the long-term trend in prices by excluding
  fluctuations caused by items like food and energy prices. This indicator
  focuses on core inflation, which provides a more stable measure of price
  changes. By analyzing the change in underlying inflation rate, economists,
  policymakers, businesses, and consumers can understand whether inflationary
  pressures are increasing or decreasing without the influence of volatile
  components. This information is valuable for decision-making processes, such
  as formulating monetary policy or making informed financial and economic
  choices.
Disaggregation: National
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring change in inflation rate is crucial because it provides insights
  into the purchasing power of money, helps anticipate future price movements,
  and informs economic policy decisions.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  The basic methodology for calculating the change in inflation rate involves
  comparing the price levels of a basket of goods and services over two
  different time periods and determining the percentage difference between them.
