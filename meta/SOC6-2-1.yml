Concept: "\u2022\tSOE\u2019s place a heavy burden on Vanuatu\u2019s economy. They\
  \ absorb large amounts of scarce capital on which they provide very low returns,\
  \ at the same time divert government resources away from vital social investments\
  \ in health and education, and drive-up the costs of doing business where they are\
  \ the sole service providers. Therefore, it is really important to identify the\
  \ proportion of SOE\u2019s who have already submitted their annual reports because\
  \ it can be used as a measure for performances of the SOE\u2019s which are aligned\
  \ to the Government priorities. And also, to help with the reforms of State-Owned\
  \ Enterprises in relation to their performances and the delivery of the services\
  \ and support they provide to all citizens of Vanuatu. "
