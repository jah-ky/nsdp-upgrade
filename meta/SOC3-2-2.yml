   By 2020, the incidence of TB in Vanuatu has reduced by 20% compared to 2015 
   By 2025-50% reduction 
   By 2030- 80% reduction
SDGAlignment: '' 
Definition: >-
  The tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population as defined as the estimated
  number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases in people
  living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a rate per 100 000
  population.
Concept: >-
  Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which
  underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that
  under-diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect estimates are based on
  notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and
  under-diagnosis.
Rationale: >-
  The overall goal is to “End the global tuberculosis epidemic”, and
  correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and
  cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the
  level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of
  the SDGs.
