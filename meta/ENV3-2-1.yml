Concept: To be effective, early warning systems need to actively involve the people
  and communities at risk from a range of hazards, facilitate public education and
  awareness of risks, disseminate messages and warnings efficiently and ensure that
  there is a constant state of preparedness and that early action is enabled with
  maintenance plans in place.
