Definition: >-
  refers to the overall quantity or count of processed goods that are
  manufactured or made within Vanuatu during a one-year period. These products
  undergo some form of processing or transformation, such as refining,
  manufacturing, packaging, or other value-added activities.


  The purpose of producing these local products is twofold:


  1. Domestic consumption: They are intended for use within the country or
  region where they are produced. These products cater to the local market and
  fulfill the demands and needs of the population residing within that area.


  2. Export: The products are also manufactured with the intention of being sold
  and distributed in international markets. They are meant for consumption by
  customers located outside the country or region of origin. Exporting local
  products allows a country to generate revenue, boost economic growth, and
  enhance its trade relations with other nations.


  The "Total number" in this context represents the aggregate count of these
  processed local products. It could be measured in terms of individual units,
  such as kilograms, liters, pieces, or any other appropriate unit of
  measurement based on the nature of the product.


  The timeframe considered for this measurement is "per annum," which means it
  represents the production and processing of local products over a one-year
  period.
Concept: >-
  To find the total number of processed local products produce annually for
  domestic consumption and export so that Vanuatu can look for ways to increase
  by 10% production and processing niche commodities by 2020.
Disaggregation: ''
Rationale: >-
  To depict total number of processed local products produced per anum for
  domestic consumption and export. So that production of processed local
  products must increase by 10% by the year 2020. And therefore, enabling a
  competitive business environment and creating more opportunities and
  employments for entrepreneurs throughout Vanuatu.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  For products intended for export, trade data can be utilized. Customs
  department and statistics trade organizations maintain records of exports,
  including the quantity or volume of goods shipped to different destinations.
  By analyzing this trade data, you can determine the total number of processed
  local products exported during a given period.
