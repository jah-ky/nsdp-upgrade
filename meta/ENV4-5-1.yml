Rationale: The Fisheries management plan should be done because it is,to maintain
  the target species at or above the levels necessary to ensure their continued productivity
  (biological),to minimise the impacts of fishing on the physical environment and
  on non-target (bycatch), associated and dependent species (ecological);to maximise
  the net incomes of the participating fishers (economic); and to maximise employment
  opportunities for those dependent on the fishery for their livelihoods (social).
