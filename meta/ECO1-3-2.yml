Concept: "The debt-to-GDP ratio is the metric comparing a country's public debt to\
  \ its gross domestic product (GDP). By comparing what a country owes with what it\
  \ produces, the debt-to-GDP ratio reliably indicates that particular country\u2019\
  s ability to pay back its debts. Often expressed as a percentage, this ratio can\
  \ also be interpreted as the number of years needed to pay back debt, if GDP is\
  \ dedicated entirely to debt repayment.\nA country able to continue paying interest\
  \ on its debt--without refinancing, and without hampering economic growth, is generally\
  \ considered to be stable. A country with a high debt-to-GDP ratio typically has\
  \ trouble paying off external trades (also called \u201Cpublic debts\u201D), which\
  \ are any balances owed to outside lenders. In such scenarios, creditors are apt\
  \ to seek higher interest rates when lending. Extravagantly high debt-to-GDP ratios\
  \ may deter creditors from lending money altogether."

Definition: "Dept ratio to GDP is the ratio between a country\u2019s government dept\
  \ (measured in units of currency) and its gross domestic product (GDP) (Measured\
  \ in units of currency per year). A low dept \u2013 to \u2013 GDP ratio indicates\
  \ an economy that produces and sells goods and services sufficient to pay back its\
  \ depts without incurring further dept."
