Concept: The application of meteorology to agriculture is essential, since every facet
  of agricultural activity depends on the weather. This indicator will be studied
  to determine the proportion of producers that have undergone Agro-Met training.
  which is related to enhancing traditional agricultural practices that aims to address
  disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.
DataSource: Vanuatu Agriculture Census
Definition: 'Agrometeorology is the study of weather and use of weather and climate
  information to enhance or expand agricultural crops and/or to increase crop production.
  Producers who undergone Agro-met training will benefit the producers a lot in terms
  of maximising profits at the same time addressing disaster risk reduction, and climate
  change adaptation response to global warming. '
