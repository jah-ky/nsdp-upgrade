Concept: "* Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.\
  \ Thus, allowing rural households who involved more in agricultural production for\
  \ commercial activities to easily bring their produce to urban markets to sell their\
  \ goods for those in urban areas who do not have access to free land to plant their\
  \ own food.\n* Early form of trade is barter where there is direct exchange of goods\
  \ and services for other goods and services \u2013 trading without the use of money\n\
  * Countries trade with each other or their own when they do not have the resources,\
  \ or capacity to satisfy their own needs and wants. "

Rationale: "Proportion of rural households engaged in Trade with family in urban centres\
  \ will determine whether there is actually strengthening of linkages between urban\
  \ and rural business and trade between islands or not. If by 2020 there is a proportion\
  \ increase by 10 % then it is indicating that Vanuatu has a potential enabling business\
  \ environment, creating opportunities and employment for entrepreneurs throughout\
  \ Vanuatu. If there aren\u2019t any increase by 2020 then this indicator is under\
  \ reported, meaning weak linkages between urban and rural business and trade between\
  \ islands thus resulting in less opportunities and employment for entrepreneurs\
  \ throughout Vanuatu."
