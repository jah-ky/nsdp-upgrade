Definition: >-
  The percentage of households sourcing energy for lighting from renewable
  sources. Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from
  natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished.
Concept: >-
  Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity
  generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural
  (off-grid) energy services. This information can be used to provide insight
  whether the energy for lighting is derived from the main grid-based
  electricity a non-renewable resource.
Disaggregation: ''
Rationale: >-
  Renewable energy provides reliable power supplies and fuel diversification,
  which enhance energy security, lower risk of fuel spills, and reduce the need
  for imported fuels. Renewable energy also helps conserve the nation's natural
  resources. 
MethodOfComputation: >-
  Proportion of households sourcing energy for lighting from renewable sources =
  ![(Total number of households sourcing energy for lighting from renewable
  sources.)/(Total number of households  ) x
