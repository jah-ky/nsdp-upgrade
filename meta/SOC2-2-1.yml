Definition: Schools which formerly had very little say in financial management now
  receive grants directly from the central authorities. Educational management theories
  assume that grants will have other advantages resulting in less bureaucracy, fewer
  leakages in the distribution of funds, and more appropriate and selective use of
  funds by schools for their self-improvement, as well as a greater impact if more
  money reaches disadvantaged schools. Finally, grants may influence school-community
  relations and enhance school autonomy and capacity.
