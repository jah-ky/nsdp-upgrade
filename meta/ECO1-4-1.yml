  Value and volume of national trade, often referred to as merchandise trade,
  are measures used to assess the flow of goods traded between countries.


  1. Value of national trade: The value of national trade represents the
  monetary worth or financial value of goods traded between countries over a
  specific period. It is usually measured in terms of the total import and
  export values, reflecting the prices at which goods are bought and sold in
  international markets. The value of national trade provides insights into the
  economic significance of trade activities and the financial impact on
  participating countries.


  2. Volume of national trade: The volume of national trade refers to the
  physical quantity or quantity of goods traded between countries, irrespective
  of their monetary value. It is often measured in terms of weight, quantity, or
  unit of measurement (e.g., tons, barrels, units). The volume of national trade
  helps analyze the physical scale and magnitude of trade flows, indicating the
  actual quantities of goods exchanged between nations.


  Both the value and volume of national trade are crucial indicators in
  understanding the scale, dynamics, and economic impact of international trade.
  While the value reflects the monetary worth of traded goods, the volume
  provides insights into the physical quantities involved, allowing for a more
  comprehensive analysis of trade patterns and their implications for economic
  growth and development.
Concept: >-
  The main concept behind the indicator "value and volume of national
  trade/merchandise trade" is to capture and analyze the flow of goods exchanged
  between countries. It focuses on assessing the monetary value and physical
  quantity of traded goods, providing insights into the economic significance,
  scale, and dynamics of international trade. Monitoring the value and volume of
  national trade helps understand the commercial relationships between nations,
  identify trade patterns, analyze economic performance, and inform policy
  decisions related to international trade.

Rationale: >-
  The rationale behind monitoring the indicator "value and volume of national
  trade/merchandise trade" is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
  economic impact and dynamics of international trade. It serves several key
  purposes:


  1. Economic Performance: Tracking the value and volume of national trade helps
  assess a country's economic performance and its integration into the global
  economy. Increasing trade volumes and values often indicate economic growth
  and prosperity, while declining figures can signal potential challenges.


  2. Trade Patterns: Analyzing the value and volume of national trade enables
  the identification of trade patterns, such as the types of goods being traded,
  the countries involved, and the direction of trade flows. This information is
  valuable for identifying comparative advantages, evaluating market
  opportunities, and optimizing trade strategies.


  3. Policy Decisions: Governments and policymakers rely on data related to the
  value and volume of national trade to make informed decisions. It helps shape
  trade policies, negotiate trade agreements, assess the impact of tariffs and
  barriers, and develop strategies to promote domestic industries and exports.


  4. Global Economic Relations: Understanding the value and volume of national
  trade enhances the comprehension of a country's position in global economic
  relations. It allows for benchmarking against other countries, analyzing
  competitiveness, and identifying potential areas for cooperation or economic
  diversification.


  5. Economic Integration: Monitoring trade values and volumes assists in
  assessing the degree of economic integration between countries. It provides
  insights into the interdependencies and connections established through trade
  relationships, contributing to the evaluation of regional economic integration
  efforts and the overall globalization of markets.


  By tracking the value and volume of national trade, policymakers, economists,
  businesses, and researchers gain valuable insights into the economic health,
  competitiveness, and opportunities associated with international trade. It
  helps inform strategic decisions, facilitates economic growth, and promotes
  sustainable development
MethodOfComputation: >-
  The methods of computation for tracking the value and volume of national
  trade, also known as merchandise trade, involve collecting data from various
  sources such as customs records, trade statistics, and national accounts. The
  specific methodologies may vary across countries, but here are the general
  approaches used:


  1. Value of national trade: The value of national trade is calculated by
  adding the total export values and total import values for a specific time
  period. These values are typically obtained from customs data or trade
  databases, where the prices of exported and imported goods are recorded. The
  total export value represents the monetary worth of goods sold to other
  countries, while the total import value represents the monetary worth of goods
  purchased from other countries.


  2. Volume of national trade: The volume of national trade refers to the
  physical quantity or quantity of goods traded. It is often measured using
  units such as weight (e.g., tons), quantity (e.g., number of units), or other
  relevant metrics. The volume of trade is typically obtained through data on
  the physical quantities of goods exported and imported. This data can be
  derived from various sources, such as trade surveys, shipping records, or
  official statistics.


  To calculate the volume of national trade, the physical quantity of each
  traded item is aggregated for a specific time period. This allows for the
  determination of the total volume of goods exported and imported by Vanuatu.
