ComputationMethod: "p = x/n multiply 100\nWhere:\n\u201Cx\u201D is the total count\
  \ of vehicles that comply with emission standards \n\u201Cn\u201D is the total number\
  \ of vehicles registered in the country\nNote: While \u201Cp\u201D is usually used\
  \ as the symbol for the population proportion, you might also see the letter pi(\u03C0\
  ) used instead."
ComputationUnit: Percentage (%)
Concept: proportion of vehicles complying with emission standards is a very important
  indicator as it measures the extent of the waste and pollution control measures,
  put in place to combat the rise of waste and pollution impacts on the environment
  and the wellbeing of the future generations.
DataSource: Roadworthy inspections records as administrative data from Municipalities
  and Provincial area government.
Definition: '* Vehicle emissions - Cars, SUVs, and light duty trucks that are fuelled
  by gasoline, diesel, and E85 emit both greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants
  from their tailpipes

  * Emission Standards - Emission standards are the legal requirements governing air
  pollutants released into the atmosphere. Emission standards set quantitative limits
  on the permissible amount of specific air pollutants that may be released from specific
  sources over specific timeframes'

  the waste and pollution policies in order to foster sustainable growth and development
  through low impacts technologies and modern technologies to ensure the well-being
  of future generations.
