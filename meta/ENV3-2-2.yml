  enhance overall resilience.


  4. Communication infrastructure development: Assessing the proportion of the
  population with access to early warning technologies helps identify areas
  where communication infrastructure needs to be strengthened or expanded. It
  supports the development and investment in technologies that can disseminate
  warnings efficiently and reach a larger number of people.


  5. Monitoring progress and impact: Over time, tracking changes in the
  proportion of the population with access to early warning technologies allows
  for monitoring progress in disaster risk reduction efforts. It helps measure
  the impact of interventions, policies, and investments aimed at improving the
  dissemination of early warnings.


  By focusing on this indicator, policymakers and organizations can work towards
  bridging the digital divide, improving information dissemination mechanisms,
  and ensuring that all segments of the population have equal access to
  technologies that convey early warnings, thereby enhancing overall
  preparedness and resilience in the face of disasters and emergencies.

MethodOfComputation: >-
  The computation method for measuring the "Proportion of population with access
  to technologies that conveys early warnings" can vary depending on the
  specific context and available data. Here's a general approach to calculating
  this indicator:


  1. Define the target population: Determine the specific population or
  geographic area for which you want to measure access to early warning
  technologies. It could be a national population, a specific region, or a
  community.


  2. Identify relevant technologies: Determine the technologies that are
  considered early warning systems in the context you are assessing. This may
  include mobile phones, internet access, radio and television networks, weather
  monitoring systems, etc.


  3. Collect data on technology access: Gather data on the availability and
  usage of the identified technologies within the target population. This can be
  obtained through surveys, census data, or existing reports from relevant
  agencies or organizations.


  4. Determine access criteria: Define the criteria for considering someone to
  have access to early warning technologies. For example, it could be based on
  ownership or regular usage of mobile phones, internet access at home or public
  facilities, access to radio or television broadcasts, etc.


  5. Calculate the proportion: Calculate the proportion of the target population
  that meets the access criteria for each technology. Divide the number of
  individuals with access by the total population and multiply by 100 to obtain
  the percentage.

     Proportion = (Number of individuals with access / Total population) x 100

  6. Aggregate the proportions: If you are assessing multiple technologies,
  calculate the proportion for each technology separately, and then aggregate
  them to obtain an overall measure. This could be done by averaging the
  proportions or assigning different weights based on the significance of each
  technology.


  7. Interpretation and analysis: Analyze the calculated proportion to
  understand the level of access to early warning technologies within the
  population. Compare the results over time or across different regions or
  demographic groups to identify disparities, trends, or improvements in access.


  It's important to note that the accuracy and reliability of the measurement
  depend on the quality and representativeness of the data collected.
  Additionally, the specific context and objectives may require customization of
  the computation method.
