Definition: >-
  The term “first language” refers to the language a person is most familiar
  with and most accustomed to speaking. Usually, it is the language that a
  person hears and eventually learns in the following years after he was born.
  The term is largely differentiated from other terms such as the “mother
  tongue,” as this generally refers to the language of a collective group, not
  of a person.
Concept: >-
  The concept of the indicator "proportion of population first language learned
  indigenous" refers to a specific measure used to assess the percentage of a
  population that acquired their first language from indigenous communities.

  into the preservation and transmission of indigenous languages to future
  generations.
MethodOfComputation: >-

  by the total sample population surveyed then multiplied by 100 to find the
  percentage value.
