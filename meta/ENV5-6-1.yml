Concept: "Environmental management information system (EMIS), is an environmental\
  \ data base that was established within the department of Environmental Protection\
  \ and Conservation (DEPC) in 2018 funded by UNDP, under a project called, Mainstreaming\
  \ Global Environmental priorities into national policies and programmes (CB2/CCCD\
  \ Project). The database hosts environmental data that is collected by the department\
  \ of Environment and other stakeholders (ie: government departments and other NGO\u2019\
  s) that collect environmental data throughout Vanuatu. The EMIS is designed according\
  \ to the Peoples Plan (NSDP) Environmental Pillar 2 indicators and the National\
  \ Environmental Policy and Implementation Plan (NEPIP) indicators."

Definition: Environmental data is based on the measurement of environmental pressure,
  the state of the Environment (SOE) and the impacts on the ecosystem. Since environment
  is a cross cutting issue environmental data is generated by other institutions that
  execute environmental activities and are shared. The environmental database system
  is a set of components that is defined to control the collection of environmental
  data, its storage, management and its use of data.

  \ issues and also for reporting purposes to international treaties (MEA\u2019s),\
  \ the Rio Conventions (i.e.: UNCBD, UNFCCC, UNCCD) signed by the government of Vanuatu,\
  \ under the ministry of Climate change and Adaptation (MoCCA) and other national\
