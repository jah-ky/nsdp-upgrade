Rationale: 'Disasters affect large parts of the population, especially the poor and
  other marginalized groups. Between 1950 and 2011 disasters in the Pacific islands
  region affected approximately 4 million people, caused 8,693 reported deaths and
  resulted in damage costs of around US$3.2 billion. Tropical cyclones, the major
  cause of these losses and damage, are expected to increase in intensity, though
  not frequency, in most parts of the Pacific over the coming decades.  '
