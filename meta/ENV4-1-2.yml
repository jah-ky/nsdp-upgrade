Concept: '* Objective of planning land use is to influence, control or direct changes
  in the use of land, so that it is dedicated to the most beneficial use while maintaining
  the quality of the environment and promoting conservation of the land resources.


  * Goals of land use planning may include environmental conservation, restraint of
  urban sprawl, minimization of transport costs, prevention of land use conflicts,
  and a reduction in exposure to pollutants. By and large, the uses of land determine
  the diverse socioeconomic activities that occur in a specific area, the patterns
  of human behaviour they produce, and their impact on the environment.'
