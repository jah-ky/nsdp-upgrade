Definition: >-
  GDP growth refers to the increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a
  country over a specific period of time, typically measured on an annual basis.
  It represents the rate at which the total value of goods and services produced
  within an economy is expanding. GDP growth is a key indicator of economic
  health and is influenced by factors such as consumer spending, investment,
  government expenditure, and net exports. Positive GDP growth generally
  signifies economic expansion, while negative growth indicates economic
  contraction or recession.
Concept: >-
  The concept behind the indicator "GDP growth" is to measure the rate at which
  an economy is expanding or contracting over a specific period. It provides a
  quantitative assessment of the overall economic performance of a country by
  capturing the increase or decrease in the value of goods and services produced
  within its borders. GDP growth is an essential tool for assessing economic
  health, identifying trends, comparing performance across countries, and
  informing policy decisions. It reflects the combined impact of various
  factors, including consumer spending, business investment, government
  expenditure, and net exports, providing an overview of the overall economic
  activity and output of a nation.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring GDP growth annually allows policymakers, businesses, and economists
  to gauge the overall health and performance of an economy, identify trends,
  make informed decisions, and assess the effectiveness of economic policies
MethodOfComputation: >-
  The method of computation for annual GDP growth involves comparing the GDP
  values of an economy between two different periods (typically one year apart)
  and calculating the percentage change in GDP over that period using the
  formula:

  GDP growth rate = ((GDP at the end of the period - GDP at the start of the
  period) / GDP at the start of the period) * 100.
