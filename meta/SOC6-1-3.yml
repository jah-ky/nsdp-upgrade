  \ good or service and lowers the overall price of the good or service. Examples\
  \ of State Own Enterprise: Airports Vanuatu LTD, Vanuatu Post LTD, Reserve Bank\
  \ of Vanuatu, Vanuatu Agriculture Development Bank, National Bank of Vanuatu, National\
  \ Housing, Vanuatu Broadcasting & Television Corporation, Interchange LTD."
