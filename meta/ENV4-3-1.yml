ComputationUnit: Percentage (%)
Concept: '* The process of extraction of mineral resources involves digging them out
  to the service of the earth where the area is becoming an open pit or clearing of
  an area for agricultural purposes which exposes the area to direct rainfall and
  heavy washed, thus eventually eroded as the materials are washed down or wash down
  stream.


  * EIA procedures are designed to identify environmental problems which may be caused
  by a development project and determine the magnitude of change in the environment.

Definition: '* Extraction is the term referring to the action of extracting something
  by effort or force, extraction activities in the envronment refer to different activites
  done in the environment in terms of extracting or removing natural resources which
  in fact relate to different environmental issues.


  * Land Degradation is defined as the reduction or loss of the biological or economic
  productivity and productivity and complexity of rain fed cropland, irrigated cropland,
  or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting from a combination of pressures,
  including land use and management practices.


  * Downstream Environmental damage from mineral resources extracted is one way of
  environmental damage caused by surface related to large amount of surface material
  that humans remove during mining operation or due to erosion which is exposed of
  hillside through clearing or drainage.'
