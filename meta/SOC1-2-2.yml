  refers to the percentage or fraction of a population that has the knowledge
  and abilities to engage in fundamental traditional activities associated with
  weaving, transportation, construction of housing, farming, and food
  preparation.


  Here's a breakdown of each component:


  Weaving: This refers to the skill of creating fabric or textiles by
  interlacing threads or yarns together. Traditional weaving techniques are
  often passed down through generations and involve the use of looms or other
  tools.


  Transport: This encompasses the knowledge and skills related to traditional
  methods of transportation, such as using animals, carts, boats, or other
  non-motorized means to move people or goods from one place to another.


  Housing: This pertains to the skills involved in constructing traditional
  housing structures using locally available materials and techniques specific
  to a particular region or culture.


  Farming: This includes the basic agricultural skills required for cultivating
  crops, raising livestock, and managing land using traditional methods and
  practices, which often rely on manual labor and non-mechanized tools.


  Food preparation: This refers to the abilities and knowledge needed to process
  and prepare food using traditional techniques, such as cooking, preserving,
  fermenting, and other methods that have been passed down through generations.

Concept: >-
  The concept behind the indicator "Proportion of population possessing common
  and basic traditional production skills related to weaving, transport,
  housing, farming, food preparation" is to assess the extent to which a
  population retains and maintains traditional knowledge and skills in essential
  areas of production. It aims to capture the level of proficiency and
  continuity of traditional practices within a community or society.


  This indicator recognizes the value of traditional production skills that have
  been passed down through generations and are deeply rooted in cultural
  heritage. It emphasizes the importance of preserving and promoting these
  skills, as they often represent sustainable and resource-efficient methods of
  production that have stood the test of time.

Rationale: >+
  The proportion of population possessing these common and basic traditional
  production skills indicates the extent to which a particular society or
  community has retained and continues to practice traditional knowledge and
  practices in these areas. It can provide insights into cultural heritage,
  self-sufficiency, and the sustainability of traditional ways of life.


  By measuring the proportion of the population possessing these common and
  basic traditional production skills, policymakers and researchers can gain
  insights into several key aspects:


  Cultural preservation: The indicator reflects the degree to which cultural
  traditions, practices, and knowledge are maintained within a society. It
  highlights the continuity of skills that have been developed and refined over
  generations, contributing to cultural identity and heritage.


  Self-sufficiency and resilience: Traditional production skills often embody
  self-reliance and resilience, as they are typically adapted to local
  environments and resources. The indicator assesses the ability of a population
  to meet its basic needs through traditional methods, which can contribute to
  food security, housing, and other essential aspects of life.


  Sustainability and environmental impact: Many traditional production skills
  are characterized by sustainable practices that minimize environmental impact.
  For example, traditional farming techniques often prioritize organic farming,
  agroecological principles, and water conservation. By measuring the proportion
  of the population possessing these skills, the indicator indirectly reflects
  the level of sustainable practices within a community.


  Economic implications: Traditional production skills can also have economic
  significance. They may contribute to local and traditional industries, crafts,
  tourism, and cultural exchanges. The indicator can help identify opportunities
  for economic development and support traditional livelihoods.


  By monitoring changes in the proportion of the population possessing these
  skills over time, policymakers can gauge the impact of modernization,
  globalization, and other factors that may influence the preservation or
  decline of traditional knowledge. It can inform the design of policies and
  interventions aimed at preserving cultural heritage, promoting sustainable
  practices, and supporting the well-being of communities engaged in traditional
  production activities.







MethodOfComputation: >-
  number of people with knowledge of basic traditional production skills related
  to weaving, transport, housing, farming, food preparation divide by the total
  sample population surveyed then multiplied by 100 to find the percentage value
