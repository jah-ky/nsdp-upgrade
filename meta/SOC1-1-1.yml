Definition: >-
  proportion of the population who report speaking their indigenous language
  every day. indigenous language simply means that  a language that originated
  in a specified place and was not brought to that place from elsewhere. 
Concept: >-
  The concept of speaking indigenous language daily for a nation based on
  traditional governance is rooted in recognizing the cultural identity and
  heritage of the people. Language is a significant aspect of a community's
  culture, and preserving and promoting indigenous languages within the daily
  lives of the people ensures that their unique heritage is not lost.
Disaggregation: 'National level, Provincial level, regional level, and by gender.'
Rationale: >-
  Traditional governance is based on cultural practices and values that have
  been passed down through generations. the use of indigenous language aligns
  with these cultural practices by providing a means for people to communicate
  with each other in a way that reflects their cultural identity and values.

  ultimately, speaking indigenous language daily is about valuing and preserving
  the heritage and culture of a community. if the majority of the population
  speaks indigenous language daily, it is a testament to the richness and
  diversity of cultures that make up our beautiful island nation.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  take number of individuals who speaks indigenous language daily over total
  population or sample population by the above level of disaggregation then
  using the calculating formula for finding percentages to calculate their
  percentages over the total population surveyed in the 2012 and 2020 National
  Population & Housing Census.
