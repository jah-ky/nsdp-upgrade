Definition: >
  The proportion of households sourcing energy for lighting from renewable
  sources refers to the percentage of households that utilize renewable energy
  sources for their lighting needs. It measures the extent to which households
  rely on renewable energy, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or
  geothermal energy, to meet their lighting requirements.


  This indicator reflects the sustainability and environmental impact of a
  household's energy consumption for lighting purposes. It provides insights
  into the adoption and utilization of renewable energy technologies at the
  household level, which can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
  mitigating climate change, and promoting a transition to cleaner and more
  sustainable energy sources.
Concept: >-
  The concept behind this indicator is to assess the sustainability and
  environmental impact of household energy consumption for lighting. By
  analyzing the proportion of households using renewable energy sources,
  policymakers and researchers can gain insights into the adoption and
  utilization of clean energy technologies at the household level.


  Households that source energy for lighting from renewable sources contribute
  to mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to
  households reliant on fossil fuel-based energy sources. Renewable energy
  sources are generally more sustainable, have lower carbon footprints, and
  offer long-term energy cost savings.


  The indicator's significance lies in its ability to inform policymakers,
  energy planners, and researchers about the progress and potential for
  renewable energy adoption at the household level. It can help identify regions
  or communities where renewable energy penetration is high or where there is a
  need for interventions to promote cleaner energy sources. Additionally, it
  assists in tracking the impact of policies, incentives, and awareness
  campaigns aimed at promoting renewable energy adoption.
Disaggregation: 'National, Provincial level.'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of households sourcing energy for lighting from
  renewable sources is crucial for assessing energy transition goals, promoting
  sustainable development, and working towards a more resilient and
  environmentally friendly energy system. It encourages the shift away from
  fossil fuel dependency and towards a more sustainable and inclusive energy
  future.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  Proportion of households sourcing energy for lighting from renewable sources =
  ![(Total number of households sourcing energy for lighting from renewable
  sources.)/(Total number of households  ) x
