  The "Proportion of population with free access to traditional lands, forest,
  and marine resources" is an indicator that measures the percentage or fraction
  of a population that enjoys unrestricted access to ancestral or traditional
  lands, forests, and marine resources without any legal, economic, or social
  barriers.


  This indicator aims to capture the level of access and rights that indigenous
  peoples, local communities, or specific cultural groups have to their
  traditional territories and the natural resources within them. It focuses on
  the concept of free access, meaning that individuals or communities can
  utilize these resources for various purposes, such as sustenance, livelihoods,
  cultural practices, and spiritual or ceremonial activities.


  Here are the key elements of this indicator:


  1. Traditional lands: This refers to the territories or areas that are
  traditionally owned, occupied, or used by indigenous peoples or local
  communities. These lands hold cultural, historical, and spiritual significance
  for these groups, and they often have deep connections to the surrounding
  ecosystems and resources.


  2. Forest resources: This includes the unrestricted access to forests and
  their resources, such as timber, non-timber forest products (e.g., medicinal
  plants, fruits, nuts), and ecosystem services (e.g., water regulation, carbon
  sequestration). It recognizes the importance of forests in providing
  livelihood opportunities and supporting cultural practices.


  3. Marine resources: This encompasses the unrestricted access to marine
  environments, including coastlines, seas, and oceans, along with their
  associated resources. It includes access to fish stocks, shellfish, marine
  plants, and other marine-based resources that support the livelihoods and
  cultural practices of coastal or fishing communities.

Concept: >-
  The indicator "Proportion of population with free access to traditional lands,
  forest, and marine resources" measures the percentage or fraction of a
  population that has unrestricted rights and ability to access and utilize
  their ancestral or traditional lands, forests, and marine resources. It
  focuses on indigenous peoples, local communities, or specific cultural groups
  and aims to evaluate their level of access without legal, economic, or social
  barriers. The indicator recognizes the significance of these resources for
  sustenance, livelihoods, cultural practices, and spiritual activities.
  Monitoring changes in this indicator helps assess the recognition of
  indigenous rights, land tenure systems, and the sustainability of traditional
  resource management.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the changes in this indicator helps assess the level of recognition
  and protection of indigenous rights, land tenure systems, and the cultural and
  environmental sustainability of traditional resource management practices. It
  informs policy and decision-making processes related to land and resource
  governance, conservation, and the promotion of indigenous rights and local
  community empowerment.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  number of people with free access to traditional lands, forest, and marine
  resources  divide by the total sample population surveyed then multiplied by
  100 to find the percentage value
