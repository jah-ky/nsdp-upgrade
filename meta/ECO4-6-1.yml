  Labor force participation measures an economy’s active labor force and refers
  to the number of people who are either employed or are actively looking for
  work.

  It is also defined as the section of working population in the age group of
  16-64 in the economy.


  The working population in different sectors can be defined as follows:


  1. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Sector: The working population in the
  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector comprises individuals who are
  employed in activities related to agricultural production, forestry, and
  fisheries management. This includes farmers, farm laborers, agricultural
  technicians, foresters, forest rangers, fishers, fish farmers, and other
  workers involved in tasks specific to these sectors.


  2. Industry Sector: The working population in the industry sector refers to
  individuals who are engaged in activities related to manufacturing,
  construction, mining, and other industrial processes. This sector involves the
  conversion of raw materials into finished goods, the construction of
  infrastructure and buildings, and the extraction of natural resources. The
  working population in this sector includes factory workers, engineers,
  technicians, construction workers, miners, and individuals involved in
  manufacturing, production, assembly, and related industrial activities.


  3. Service Sector: The working population in the service sector consists of
  individuals employed in various service-oriented industries, which focus on
  providing intangible services rather than tangible goods. This sector includes
  professions such as retail, hospitality, finance, education, healthcare,
  transportation, entertainment, and more. The working population in the service
  sector includes retail workers, hotel staff, bankers, teachers, nurses,
  drivers, artists, and individuals involved in customer service,
  administration, professional services, and other service-related activities.

Concept: >
  The working population in the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector,
  industry sector, and service sector plays a crucial role in creating a
  business environment and generating employment opportunities in Vanuatu.
  Here's a summary of how each sector contributes:


  1. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Sector: This sector provides
  opportunities for entrepreneurs by supporting agricultural production,
  forestry activities, and fisheries management. Entrepreneurs can engage in
  farming, livestock rearing, forestry management, timber production, fish
  farming, and seafood processing. The sector offers employment to a significant
  portion of the population, enabling entrepreneurs to establish businesses and
  contribute to the country's food security, raw material supply, and export
  potential.


  2. Industry Sector: The industry sector in Vanuatu involves manufacturing,
  construction, and mining activities. Entrepreneurs can establish factories,
  production facilities, construction companies, and mining operations. This
  sector creates employment opportunities for workers, engineers, technicians,
  and skilled laborers. Entrepreneurs in industries such as manufacturing can
  contribute to the country's economic growth by producing goods for local
  consumption and export.


  3. Service Sector: The service sector in Vanuatu encompasses a wide range of
  industries, including retail, hospitality, finance, education, healthcare,

  service sector is a significant source of employment, providing opportunities
  for entrepreneurs to offer services and cater to the needs of the local
  population and tourists.


  Overall, the working population in these sectors enables a vibrant business
  environment in Vanuatu. It creates opportunities for entrepreneurs to
  establish and grow businesses, contributing to economic development, job
  creation, and improved livelihoods. The agriculture, forestry, and fisheries
  sector provide essential resources, while the industry and service sectors
  offer diverse economic activities. Entrepreneurs can leverage these sectors to
  harness the country's natural resources, cultural heritage, and

MethodOfComputation: >-
  To compute the working population in Vanuatu using census data, you can follow
  these steps:


  Obtain Census Data: Access the latest available census data for Vanuatu, which
  provides information on population demographics, employment status, and
  occupation. The census data should include details on the working population
  and their distribution across sectors.


  Identify Relevant Categories: Look for specific categories or variables in the
  census data that capture employment status and occupation. These categories
  may include "employed," "unemployed," "labor force," or similar indicators
  that differentiate between individuals who are part of the working population
  and those who are not.


  Extract Sector-specific Information: Within the working population category,
  focus on extracting data related to the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries
  sector, the industry sector, and the service sector. This can be done by
  identifying occupation codes or job categories that correspond to these
  sectors in the census data.


  Tabulate the Data: Calculate the number of individuals falling within each
  sector by summing up the counts or percentages associated with the identified
  categories. This will provide you with the working population figures for the
  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector, the industry sector, and the
  service sector separately.
