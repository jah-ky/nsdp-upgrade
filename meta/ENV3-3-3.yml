Rationale: 'The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that natural disasters
  can be a barrier to realizing the development goals. Earthquakes, landslides, floods,
  and droughts have destructive impacts on overall country macroeconomic factors and
  further unreasonably affect the poor and lowered groups. Therefore, it is imperative
  to develop multi-hazard assessments that address and map both physical and social
  vulnerabilities.  '
