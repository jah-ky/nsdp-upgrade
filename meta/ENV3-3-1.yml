Concept: "* Post disaster support programmes, strategies, frameworks and plans developed\
  \ in place by the NDMO and other humanitarian response teams like Red cross Vanuatu,\
  \ Oxfam, to support communities after a disaster (man-made and natural disasters).\n\
  \n* There are two basic approaches in the post-disaster reconstruction which comprise\
  \ of the \u2018technology-based approach\u2019 and \u2018community-based approach\u2019\
  \ [2]. Technology-based approaches are usually supported by a provider policy, with\
  \ dependence on the import of dwellings from the developed donor countries. Community-based\
  \ approach in the post-disaster reconstruction promotes and depends on public participation\
  \ in reconstruction that helps build self-reliance into the affected communities\
  \ and attempts to take advantage of the local resources in a long-term development.\
  \ Implementations with this approach are sensitive to the needs of the community\
  \ and do not ignore the social aspects of the process."
