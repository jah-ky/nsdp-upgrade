Definition: The Real Environmental Obligation (ORE) is an instrument created by the
  French Biodiversity Law of 2016. It allows a landowner to voluntarily implement
  legally-binding environmental protection measures on their land via a contract with
  a legal person who becomes the guarantor of the environmental interest. In addition,
  as these protection measures are directly attached to the parcel of land, they are
  lasting, remaining in effect beyond future changes in ownership of the property
  (e.g., sale or succession)
