  The "Proportion of population with reliable access to improved sanitation
  facilities" is an indicator that measures the percentage of a population that
  has consistent and dependable access to improved sanitation facilities. It
  assesses the extent to which people have access to adequate sanitation
  services that protect human health and dignity.


  This indicator takes into account the availability, accessibility, and
  usability of sanitation facilities that meet certain standards of hygiene and
  privacy. Improved sanitation facilities include flush toilets, piped sewer
  systems, septic tanks, ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets,
  or other sanitation technologies that effectively separate human waste from
  human contact and prevent its contamination of the environment.
Concept: >-
  The concept behind this indicator is to assess the progress and effectiveness
  of efforts to provide adequate sanitation services to the population. It
  considers factors such as the availability of improved sanitation facilities,
  their functionality, accessibility, and the practices and behaviors
  surrounding sanitation and hygiene.


  The significance of this indicator lies in its contribution to public health,
  hygiene promotion, and human well-being. Access to improved sanitation
  facilities plays a vital role in preventing the spread of waterborne diseases,
  reducing exposure to health risks, and maintaining a clean and healthy
  environment.

Rationale: >-
  Monitoring the proportion of the population with reliable access to improved
  sanitation facilities helps policymakers, governments, and organizations
  identify areas or populations that lack access and prioritize interventions to
  improve sanitation infrastructure, promote hygiene education, and foster
  behavior change. It also helps track progress towards national and
  international targets for ensuring universal access to adequate sanitation for
  all.


  In summary, the "Proportion of population with reliable access to improved
  sanitation facilities" indicator serves as a measure of the extent to which a
  population has access to sanitation facilities that meet standards of hygiene
  and dignity. It emphasizes the importance of providing adequate sanitation
  services to protect public health, promote hygiene practices, and enhance the
  overall well-being of individuals and communities.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To calculate this indicator, data is collected through surveys, censuses, or
  other data collection methods that specifically inquire about the availability
  and usage of improved sanitation facilities. The number of people with access
  to reliable and improved sanitation facilities is divided by the total
  population surveyed or considered, and the result is expressed as a
  percentage.
