TargetDescription: >-
  By 2020, the prevalence of diabetes amongst the adult population is < 23 total
  cases (excluding digits) ? By 2025 there is no increase in the prevalence of
  diabetes and as such in diabetic lower-limb amputations relative to 2020
  figures (excluding digits)
SDGAlignment: ''
Definition: "The number of People living with\_diabetes, they have an increased risk of lower limb\_amputation.\_"
Concept: "A nonhealing ulcer that causes severe damage to tissues and bone may require surgical removal (amputation) of a\_toe, foot or part of a leg. Some people with diabetes\_are more at risk than others. Factors that lead to an increased risk of an amputation\_include High blood sugar levels."
Rationale: >-
  In some cases, diabetes can lead to peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD
  causes your blood vessels to narrow and reduces blood flow to your legs and
  feet. It may also cause nerve damage, known as peripheral neuropathy. The most
  common amputations in people with diabetes are the toes, feet, and lower legs.
