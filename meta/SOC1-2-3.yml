  The "Proportion of population with ability to 1: produce herbal medicines, and
  2: massage" is an indicator that measures the percentage or fraction of a
  population possessing the skills and knowledge to engage in two specific
  activities: producing herbal medicines and providing massages.


  1. Producing herbal medicines: This refers to the ability to prepare medicinal
  remedies using traditional herbal knowledge and techniques. It involves
  identifying, collecting, processing, and combining various plant materials to
  create herbal remedies for medicinal purposes. This skill often includes
  understanding the properties and uses of different plants, as well as the
  preparation methods for extracting or infusing medicinal compounds.


  2. Providing massages: This indicates the capacity to perform massages, which
  involves applying pressure, manipulation, and kneading techniques on the body
  to relieve tension, promote relaxation, and address specific health concerns.
  Massage techniques can vary depending on cultural practices and therapeutic
  approaches, encompassing modalities such as Swedish massage, Thai massage,
  aromatherapy massage, and many others. The ability to provide massages
  requires knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and specific massage techniques.
Concept: >-
  The proportion of the population with these abilities provides insight into
  several factors:


  1. Traditional healing practices: Herbal medicine production and massage often
  have roots in traditional healing systems and cultural practices. This
  indicator reflects the prevalence and continuity of traditional healing
  knowledge within a population.


  2. Healthcare access and self-care: The indicator reflects the extent to which
  the population has access to traditional healthcare alternatives and the
  ability to engage in self-care practices. It recognizes the potential for
  individuals to address their health needs using traditional methods.


  3. Cultural heritage and preservation: The indicator highlights the
  preservation and continuation of traditional healing practices and therapeutic
  techniques that are often deeply rooted in cultural heritage. It acknowledges
  the importance of passing down these skills from one generation to another.


  4. Economic implications: Traditional healing practices, including herbal
  medicine production and massage, can have economic significance. The indicator
  can provide insights into the potential for traditional healers and
  practitioners to contribute to local economies and tourism.
Disaggregation: 'National, province, region, sex'
Rationale: >-
  Monitoring changes in the proportion of the population with these abilities
  can help policymakers and researchers assess the state of traditional
  healthcare practices, identify areas where preservation efforts may be needed,
  and inform policies that support the integration of traditional medicine into
  healthcare systems.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  number of people with ability to 1: produce herbal medicines, and 2: massage
  divide by the total sample population surveyed then multiplied by 100 to find
  the percentage value
