  Level of production refers to the amount that is produced. It is a way of
  classifying production. The amount that is produced or the level of operation
  of production of a country is affected by the resources available and the
  extent to which a country is able to exploit the resources available 
Concept: >-
  There are three level of production, Primary which is more concern with the
  extraction of raw materials from the earth’s surface for instance farming and
  fishing. Secondary, this is made up of manufacturing or processing and
  construction. Lastly tertiary, made up of services used to aid the other two
  levels of production.

Rationale: >-
  The indicator "level of production of major commodities in Vanuatu" provides
  valuable insights into the country's agricultural and economic sectors. Here
  are some rationales for considering this indicator:


  1. Economic Contribution: Vanuatu's economy heavily relies on agriculture,
  with the sector playing a significant role in employment, income generation,
  and GDP contribution. Assessing the level of production of major commodities
  helps understand the economic impact of agriculture and its contribution to
  overall economic development in Vanuatu.


  2. Export Potential: Vanuatu's major commodities often have export potential,
  contributing to foreign exchange earnings and trade balance. Tracking the
  production levels of these commodities provides an indication of the country's
  export capacity and its ability to tap into international markets. It helps
  identify opportunities for expanding exports, diversifying markets, and
  reducing dependence on specific commodities.


  3. Food Security: Agriculture is crucial for domestic food security and
  nutrition. Monitoring the production of major commodities allows policymakers
  to assess the country's self-sufficiency in staple foods and identify any
  potential gaps in meeting the nutritional needs of the population. It helps
  guide strategies to promote domestic food production, reduce import
  dependence, and ensure a stable food supply for the people of Vanuatu.


  4. Employment and Livelihoods: Agriculture is a significant source of
  employment and livelihoods for many people in Vanuatu, particularly in rural
  areas. The level of production of major commodities reflects the labor demand
  and the income-generating opportunities available in the agricultural sector.
  Understanding the dynamics of commodity production helps policymakers address
  employment challenges, support rural development, and improve livelihoods for
  farmers and their communities.


  5. Sectoral Planning and Policy Formulation: Data on the production of major
  commodities assists in sectoral planning and policy formulation for
  agriculture. It helps identify areas of strength and weakness, determine
  priorities for investment, and guide interventions to enhance productivity,
  sustainability, and competitiveness in specific commodity sectors. This
  information enables evidence-based decision-making and targeted policies to
  support agricultural development.


  6. Climate Resilience and Adaptation: Vanuatu is vulnerable to climate change
  impacts that can significantly affect agricultural production. Monitoring the
  production of major commodities provides insights into the resilience of the
  agricultural sector and its capacity to adapt to climate-related challenges.
  It helps identify climate-sensitive commodities, assess the effectiveness of
  adaptation measures, and guide strategies for building climate resilience in
  agriculture.


  By analyzing the level of production of major commodities in Vanuatu,
  policymakers, economists, and stakeholders can gain a comprehensive
  understanding of the country's agricultural sector's performance, its
  contribution to the economy, and its role in food security, employment, and
  rural development. This knowledge informs policy decisions, resource
  allocation, and interventions aimed at strengthening the agricultural sector
  and promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Vanuatu.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  Trade statistics provide insights into the production levels of major
  commodities, especially for commodities that are exported or imported. By
  examining the quantities of commodities traded domestically or
  internationally, production levels can be estimated indirectly
