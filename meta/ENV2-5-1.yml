ComputationMethod: "p = x / n\nWhere:\n\u201Cx\u201D is the number of targets being\
  \ met in National Environment Policy and Implementation Plan 2016-2030 and\n\u201C\
  n\u201D is the total number of overall targets being met or not at all in NEPIP\
  \ 2016-2030\nNote: While \u201Cp\u201D is usually used as the symbol for the population\
  \ proportion, you might also see the letter pi(\u03C0) used instead."
ComputationUnit: total count, percentage (%)
Concept: The NEPIP is also part of a wider policy framework and addresses those matters
