  \ While the number of steps in the process may vary, the process will always start\
  \ with the project proponent submitting an application for an environmental permit\
  \ and will always end with the Department of Environmental protection and Conservation\u2019\
  s (the Department) decision to grant or refuse an environment permit under the EPC\
  \ Act. "
