Definition: >-
  Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per
  1,000 people at risk each year.
Concept: >-
  Case of malaria is defined as the occurrence of malaria infection in a person
  whom the presence of malaria parasites in the blood has been confirmed by a
  diagnostic test. The population considered is the population at risk of the
  disease.
Rationale: >-
  To measure trends in malaria morbidity and to identify locations where the
  risk of disease is highest. With this information, programmes can respond to
  unusual trends, such as epidemics, and direct resources to the populations
  most in need. This data also serves to inform global resource allocation for
  malaria such as when defining eligibility criteria for Global Fund finance.
