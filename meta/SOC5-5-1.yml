Definition: "This indicator focuses mainly on the rule of law (ie: our laws that are\
  \ well defined under the constitution (Mama Law of Vanuatu), these includes any\
  \ other laws that are made at National, Provincial and at the community level by\
  \ the chiefs) which address justice. This indicator aims to measure the number of\
  \ community engagement activities that are carried out by law enforcement officers\
  \ from the national level brought down to the community level and how they can be\
  \ linked and adapted by the communities. \n\nVanuatu has several institutions which\
  \ deal with justice, crime and enforcement of other laws which are set by the country\
  \ in order to address justice in a timely manner to all citizens of Vanuatu. For\
  \ instance, Ministry of Justice, Crime unit, Vanuatu Police Force (VPF), Vanuatu\
  \ Mobile Force (VMF), Woman Affairs, Malvatumauri council of chiefs... Etc, are\
  \ responsible for providing activities to the community level to address these laws.\
  \  It strengthens links between traditional (chiefs) and formal justice to make\
  \ sure that everyone from the National level to the community level are aware of\
  \ these laws and that justice prevails through out the country."
