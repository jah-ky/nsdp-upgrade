Definition: >-
  A bilateral or trade by trade agreement is a legally binding agreement between
  Vanuatu and other pacific island countries that aims to reduce barriers to
  trade and promote economic cooperation. These agreements typically cover a
  range of issues, such as the reduction or elimination of tariffs, the removal
  of non-tariff barriers, the facilitation of customs procedures, and the
  protection of intellectual property rights. The purpose of such agreements is
  to promote the flow of goods and services between participating countries,
  enhance market access, and foster economic growth and development. They are
  often negotiated and established through rounds of negotiations and can have a
  significant impact on international trade and economic relations.
Concept: >2-
   Trade by Trade agreement suggests a focus on the specific trade aspects or provisions within such agreements. It emphasizes the importance of trade-related policies, market access, tariffs, quotas, and regulations that directly impact the exchange of goods and services between participating countries.

  By examining the trade provisions within a trade agreement, policymakers,
  economists, and analysts can evaluate the potential benefits, challenges, and
  implications for industries, consumers, and the overall economy. It allows for
  an assessment of how the agreement affects trade flows, market opportunities,
  and competitiveness, and provides insights into the impact on specific sectors
  or industries. Understanding the trade provisions in a trade agreement is
  crucial for businesses engaging in cross-border trade, as it shapes the rules
  and conditions under which they can access foreign markets and compete
  internationally.

Rationale: >-
  The rationale behind monitoring trade by trade agreements as an indicator is
  to understand the economic relationships and trade dynamics between two or
  more specific countries. Trade by trade agreements are established to promote
  economic cooperation and reduce barriers to trade between the participating
  countries. Monitoring these agreements provides insights into the objectives,
  terms, and conditions of trade between the countries involved. It allows
  policymakers, businesses, and economists to assess the impact of these
  agreements on market access, tariff reductions, regulatory alignment,
  investment flows, and other trade-related aspects. Understanding bilateral
  trade agreements helps identify opportunities and challenges for businesses
  operating in the involved countries, evaluate the effectiveness of trade
  policies, and assess the potential for increased trade and economic
  cooperation between specific trading partners.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  The computation methods can include the following:


  1. Total Trade Value: Calculate the total value of exports and imports between
  the countries involved in the multilateral trade agreement. This can be done
  by summing up the monetary value of all traded goods and services recorded in
  official trade statistics or trade databases.


  2. Trade Balance: Calculate the trade balance between the countries by
  subtracting the total value of imports from the total value of exports. A
  positive trade balance indicates that exports exceed imports, while a negative
  trade balance suggests that imports surpass exports.


  3. Tariff Revenue: Assess the tariff revenue generated from trade flows
  between the countries. This involves calculating the total amount of customs
  duties collected on imports and exports based on the agreed tariff rates. This
  information can be obtained from customs records or official government
  reports.


  4. Sector-specific Analysis: Conduct a sector-specific analysis to determine
  the value of trade in specific industries or sectors covered by the
  multilateral trade agreement. This can involve examining the monetary value of
  trade in key sectors and tracking changes over time to evaluate the impact of
  the agreement on those sectors.


  5. Preferential Tariff Analysis: Analyze the utilization of preferential
  tariff rates agreed upon in the multilateral trade agreement. Calculate the
  share of imports and exports that receive preferential treatment and assess
  the value of trade conducted at lower tariff rates as a result of the
  agreement.


  Monitoring multilateral trade agreements in monetary value requires access to
  reliable trade data, such as official trade statistics, customs records, and
  other relevant sources. Regular data collection, analysis, and comparison
  against the commitments and objectives of the agreement help assess the
  economic impact, trade patterns, and compliance with the agreed terms.
