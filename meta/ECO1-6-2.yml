  The total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of GDP refers to
  the value of trade covered by various agreements in relation to a country's
  Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is a measure that helps assess the
  significance of trade agreements in the context of a country's overall
  economic output.
Concept: >-
  The concept of the total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion
  of GDP is a measure that examines the value of trade covered by agreements in
  relation to a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It helps gauge the
  significance of trade agreements in the context of a nation's overall economic
  output.

  This indicator provides insights into the potential impact of trade agreements
  on a country's economy. A higher proportion suggests that a considerable share
  of a country's trade is conducted under favorable conditions enabled by the
  agreements. This can lead to increased market access, reduced barriers to
  trade, and enhanced economic cooperation with partner countries.

Rationale: >-
  The rationale behind considering the total estimated value of trade agreements
  as a proportion of GDP lies in the understanding that international trade
  plays a vital role in a country's economic development. Here are some key
  rationales for examining this indicator:


  1. Economic Integration: Trade agreements promote economic integration by
  establishing preferential trade arrangements among participating countries. By
  quantifying the value of trade covered by these agreements as a proportion of
  GDP, policymakers and analysts can assess the extent of economic integration
  and interdependence between countries. Higher proportions indicate a deeper
  level of integration and collaboration.


  2. Market Access: Trade agreements often grant participating countries
  improved market access by reducing trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and
  non-tariff barriers. The higher the proportion of trade covered by agreements
  in relation to GDP, the greater the market access and potential for increased
  export opportunities for businesses in the participating countries. This can
  lead to expanded markets, increased sales, and economic growth.


  3. Trade Diversification: Trade agreements can encourage diversification of a
  country's export markets and sources of imports. A higher proportion of trade
  covered by agreements implies that a significant portion of a country's trade
  is conducted with partner countries under favorable terms. This
  diversification helps reduce dependence on a limited number of trading
  partners and provides resilience against economic shocks.


  4. Investment and Economic Growth: Trade agreements often include provisions
  to facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. When the proportion of
  trade covered by agreements is substantial relative to GDP, it signals an
  environment conducive to investment and economic growth. Trade agreements can
  attract foreign investors seeking access to larger markets and a stable
  business environment, thereby stimulating economic activity and creating job
  opportunities.


  5. Competitive Advantage: The total estimated value of trade agreements as a
  proportion of GDP reflects the competitiveness of participating countries. A
  higher proportion suggests that these countries have a comparative advantage
  in certain sectors and industries, enabling them to capture a significant
  share of trade under favorable terms. This competitiveness can drive
  productivity, innovation, and specialization, enhancing overall economic
  performance.


  6. Economic Stability: Trade agreements can contribute to economic stability
  by fostering predictable and transparent trading rules. When a substantial
  portion of a country's trade is governed by stable trade agreements, it
  reduces uncertainty and the risk of abrupt disruptions in trade flows. This
  stability provides a conducive environment for businesses to plan investments,
  engage in long-term contracts, and drive sustained economic growth.


  By examining the total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of
  GDP, policymakers, economists, and analysts can gain insights into the level
  of economic integration, market access, diversification, investment potential,
  competitiveness, and stability associated with the trade agreements. These
  factors are essential for formulating effective trade policies, attracting
  investments, and promoting sustainable economic development.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  To calculate this indicator, the total estimated value of trade covered by
  trade agreements is divided by the country's GDP and expressed as a
  percentage. The trade covered by agreements can include both imports and
  exports between the participating countries, which enjoy preferential terms
  and reduced barriers as a result of the trade agreements.
