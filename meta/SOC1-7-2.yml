  The "Proportion of population that use traditional lands for agriculture,
  marine, forestry, and livestock for consumption or customary purposes" is an
  indicator that measures the percentage or fraction of a population that
  engages in traditional land-based activities for agriculture, marine resource
  utilization, forestry, and livestock rearing for consumption or customary
  purposes.


  Here's a breakdown of each component:


  1. Agriculture: This refers to the practice of cultivating crops, raising
  livestock, and managing land for the production of food, fiber, or other
  agricultural products. Traditional agricultural practices often involve using
  local seeds, organic fertilizers, and traditional farming techniques suited to
  the local environment and cultural practices.


  2. Marine resource utilization: This encompasses the utilization of marine or
  aquatic resources such as fish, shellfish, seaweed, and other marine organisms
  for consumption or other traditional purposes. It includes activities like
  traditional fishing, gathering marine resources, and utilizing coastal
  ecosystems sustainably.


  3. Forestry: This involves the traditional use and management of forests and
  forest resources for various purposes, including timber, non-timber forest
  products, and ecosystem services. Traditional forestry practices often
  prioritize sustainable harvesting methods, selective logging, and the
  conservation of biodiversity and cultural values associated with forests.


  4. Livestock rearing: This refers to the traditional rearing and management of
  livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, or other animals, for consumption or
  customary purposes. Traditional livestock practices often involve herding,
  grazing on communal lands, and utilizing traditional knowledge for animal
  husbandry.

   
Concept: >-
  The indicator "Proportion of population that use traditional lands for
  agriculture, marine, forestry, and livestock for consumption or customary
  purposes" measures the percentage or fraction of a population that engages in
  traditional land-based activities for agriculture, marine resource
  utilization, forestry, and livestock rearing. It focuses on the population's
  use of traditional lands for these purposes, highlighting the importance of
  customary practices for sustenance, cultural continuity, and traditional
  resource management. Monitoring this indicator helps assess the prevalence of
  traditional land use practices, the impact of modernization on traditional
  livelihoods, and the need for policies that support sustainable practices,
  community resilience, and the protection of indigenous rights and cultural
  heritage.

Rationale: >-
  The indicator aims to assess the proportion of the population that engages in
  these traditional land-based activities, indicating the level of reliance on
  traditional practices for sustenance, cultural continuity, and customary
  purposes. It emphasizes the importance of preserving traditional knowledge,
  sustainable resource management practices, and the cultural significance of
  these activities.


  Monitoring changes in this indicator provides insights into the continuity of
  traditional land-based practices, the impact of modernization and
  industrialization on traditional livelihoods, and the need for policies and
  interventions that support sustainable traditional land use, community
  resilience, and the protection of indigenous rights and cultural heritage.
MethodOfComputation: >-
  number of people  that use traditional lands for agriculture, marine,
  forestry, and livestock for consumption or customary purposes divide by the
  total sample population surveyed then multiplied by 100 to find the percentage
  value
