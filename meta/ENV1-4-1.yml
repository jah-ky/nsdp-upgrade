ComputationUnit: 'Total Count '
Concept: ' This indicator tries to find the total FADs per 1,000 people in each province
  to improve accessibility of appropriate technology, knowledge, and skills in food
  production, preservation and storage. Ensuring our food and nutrition security needs
  are adequately met for all people through increasing sustainable food production
  systems and improving household production.'

Definition: A fish aggregating (or aggregation) device (FAD) is a man-made object
  used to attract ocean going pelagic fish such as marlin, tuna and mahi-mahi (dolphin
  fish). They usually consist of buoys or floats tethered to the ocean floor with
  concrete blocks. Fish tend to move around FADs in varying orbits, rather than remaining
  stationary below the buoys. Both recreational and commercial fisheries use FADs

Rationale: 'This study is all about collecting the total number of FADs per 1,000
  population by province so that another 100 FADs can be distributed throughout Vanuatu
  by 2030 to improve access to appropriate technology, knowledge and skills in food
  production, preservation and storage throughout Vanuatu. '
