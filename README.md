# Indicators for the National Sustainable Development Plan

The national sustainable development goals and policy objectives outlined in Vanuatu 2030: The Peopleâ€™s Plan (National Sustainable Development Plan 2016 to 2030) are the overarching guide for government planning over the next 15 years. Together they articulate a path for Vanuatu to emerge as a much stronger nation, renewing our traditions and values, and creating economic opportunities for all.
