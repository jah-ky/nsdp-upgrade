# Reporting Status


The reporting status gives you an overview of how many [National Sustainable Development Plan Indicators](https://www.gov.vu/index.php/resources/vanuatu-2030) of Vanuatu’s 2030 People’s Plan can currently be calculated. The time series for the calculation of the indicators are mainly based on data from official statistics, but 
also use data collected by many other institutions. 

Where data are available, the indicator is marked as **Reported online**. When a suitable data source is still being sought for other indicators, these are marked as **Exploring data sources**.
