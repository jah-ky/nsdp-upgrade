## Vanuatu’s National Sustainable Development Plan
 
!(/assets/img/nsdp_icon.png)The national sustainable development goals and policy objectives outlined in Vanuatu 2030: The People's Plan (National Sustainable Development Plan    2016 to 2030) are the overarching guide for government planning over the next 15 years. Together they articulate a path for Vanuatu to emerge as a much stronger nation, renewing its traditions and values, and creating economic opportunities for all. The implementation of the goals will depend on a strengthened social contract between the government and the people it serves. It requires the active participation of civil society, the private sector and our international development partners.

The Plan sets 15 goals under three pillars (Society, Environment, and Economy), 98 policy objectives, 196 indicators and 205 targets. The society pillar seeks to ensure we maintain a vibrant cultural identity underpinning a peaceful, just and inclusive society that is supported by responsive and capable institutions, delivering quality services to all citizens. The environment pillar seeks to ensure a pristine natural environment on land and at sea that continues to serve our food, cultural, economic and ecological needs, and enhance resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change and natural disasters. The economy pillar seeks to ensure we have a stable economy based on equitable, sustainable growth that creates jobs and income earning opportunities accessible to all people in rural and urban areas.

**National reporting on sustainable development in Vanuatu**
The Vanuatu National Statistics Office in partnership with the Department of Strategic Policy, Planning & Aid Coordination is responsible for coordinating and publishing national data for Vanuatu on the NSDP indicators and for statistical reporting on Vanuatu’s progress in this area.

**Data Flow Chart (Create one for Vanuatu)**
In September 2021, the Vanuatu National Statistics Office activated the online platform for the indicators of the NSDP. Here you can find time series and associated metadata for Vanuatu on national sustainable development in a processed and interactive form. The area on the NSDP on the [online platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-germany.github.io/) enables the responsible international organizations (custodian agencies) to download the data for individual NSDP indicators for Vanuatu directly and use them, for example, for global reporting.
