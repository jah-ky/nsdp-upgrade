The NSDP Baseline Survey is an expanded Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and is inclusive of health educational, cultural, and productive dimensions previous uncollected or in need of updating. The Baseline Survey has provided vital information for informing policy at the highest level in Vanuatu â€” decisions on future programmes and projects undertaken by the government and development partners will use data collected through this major household survey. The NSDP Baseline Survey produced a comprehensive data set expected to report on 38 key NSDP monitoring and evaluation indicators and 23 UN Sustainable Development Goal target indicators, making it the largest and most informative household survey we have undertaken as a nation. Teams collected data in all six provinces and both urban centres for the entirety of the collection period visiting roughly 4,800 randomly selected households across 39 islands. The survey was financed by the Government of Vanuatu, with significant support from the Republic of India through the newly established Commonwealth Window of the India-UN Development Partnership Fund.
