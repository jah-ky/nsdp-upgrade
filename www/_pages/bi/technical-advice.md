The project code for the NSDP online platform is publicly available in the [Vanuatu National Statistics GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office). GitHub is where over 65 million developers shape the future of software, together. The Vanuatu National Statistics Office is the first government instiution in the Pacific to enhance evidence based decision-making through the application of GitHub. Data scientists need to use Github for much the same reason that software engineers do — for collaboration, 'safely' making changes to projects and being able to track and rollback changes over time. It is, therefore, becoming more and more important that data scientists are proficient in the use of version control.

A universal version of the code developed by the US, UK and the Center for Open Data Enterprise for an online platform is available. The NSDP online platform is based on this. If you are interested, we recommend that you review the SDG online platforms in the USA and Great Britain and the corresponding Open SDG project documentation to familiarise. This contains technical instructions on how, for example, a copy of the Open SDG online platform can be created.
