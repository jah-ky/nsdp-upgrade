The Department of Finance and Treasury monitors the execution (use) of the budget passed by Parliament by comparing the outturn against the budget, i.e. actual expenditure against planned expenditure. While the Government cannot legally exceed the budget, it is also important to manage actual spending against planned spending from an efficiency perspective. It is easier to analyse the budget when it is broken down by program and activity, for example by just looking at expenditure on improving food security, on correctional services or on water resources, rather than an entire ministry or even the whole Government. It is also helpful to breakdown expenditure into types of spending, e.g. payroll, operations and capital expenditure. 

While it is relatively straightforward to plan spending on payroll, as organisational structures and staff salaries do not normally change much throughout the year, unexpected events do occur. Generally, the payroll budget is underspent, as ministries must budget for any staff vacancies that they wish to fill during the year, and they cannot immediately hire new staff on 1st January, leading to underspending against budget during the recruitment process. In terms of operations, it can take time to plan projects and undertake the procurement process, delaying the planned activities and leading to underspending in a given financial year. Alternatively, activities can cost more than planned, due to unforeseen circumstances.
