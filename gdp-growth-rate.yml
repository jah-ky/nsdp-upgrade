  ## Real Economic growth rate adjusted for inflation or deflation


  The GDP growth rate compares the year-over-year (or quarterly) change in a
  country’s economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. Usually
  expressed as a percentage rate, this measure is popular for economic
  policy-makers because GDP growth is thought to be closely connected to key
  policy targets such as inflation and unemployment rates. If GDP growth rates
  accelerate, it may be a signal that the economy is “overheating” and the
  central bank may seek to raise interest rates. Conversely, central banks see a
  shrinking (or negative) GDP growth rate (i.e., a recession) as a signal that
  rates should be lowered and that stimulus may be necessary.​
